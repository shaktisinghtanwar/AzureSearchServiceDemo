# Configuring Azure Search to index JSON data

This demo shows how to create an Azure Search Instance and index JSON files stored in an associated Blob Storage account.

1) The ARM template will deploy both Search and Blob Storage using the button below.  Note - keep the search and blob names short as there is a maximum length of 24 characters and the ARM template will add a guid to the end of the value you provide. [![Deploy to Azure](http://azuredeploy.net/deploybutton.png)](https://azuredeploy.net/).

You will need 4 things for the subsequent REST calls, so gather these now from the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com):
- **mysearch**: the name of your search instance.  This will be the name you gave to search in the ARM provisioning process, plus some unique characters.
- **apikey**: the Primary/Secondary Admin Key for your search instance.
- **blobname**: the name of your blob storage instance.   This will be the name you gave to blob storage in the ARM provisioning process, plus some unique characters.
- **blobaccountkey**: the Azure Storage Access Key (either key1 or key2).

2) Create a container in the blob storage account called "allblobs" (you can call it something different, but you'll have to change the REST calls to reflect it), and upload a sample file to it. I used a publicly available [food hygeine dataset](https://data.gov.uk/dataset/uk-food-hygiene-rating-data-yorkshire-and-humberside-food-standards-agency/resource/b290ee03-1405-4b90-ae63-2ae09d8c7791) from DATA.GOV.UK.  The data is available in XML format so I used a simple XML to JSON transformation - the converted file is available [here](https://github.com/jamesemann/azuresearch/blob/master/sampledata.json) if you want to use this.  I recommend using [Azure Storage Explorer](http://storageexplorer.com/) for uploading the file.

3) Next, you need to create a search index.

```
POST https://<mysearch>.search.windows.net/indexes?api-version=2015-02-28-Preview 
Content-Type: application/json 
api-key: <apikey>

{
 "name": "default",  
 "fields": [
  {"name": "id", "type": "Edm.String", "key": true, "searchable": false},
  {"name": "businessname", "type": "Edm.String", "searchable": true, "filterable": true, "sortable": true, "facetable": true}
 ]
}

```
4) Then, add a data source to point to your blob storage account.

```
POST https://<mysearch>.search.windows.net/datasources?api-version=2015-02-28-Preview 
Content-Type: application/json 
api-key: <apikey>

{
    "name" : "blob-datasource",
    "type" : "azureblob",
    "credentials" : { "connectionString" : "DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=<blobname>;AccountKey=<blobaccountkey>" },
    "container" : { "name" : "allblobs" }
}   

```
5) Once the data source has been added, then you need to add an indexer, which maps the data source to the index.

```
POST https://<mysearch>.search.windows.net/indexers?api-version=2015-02-28-Preview 
Content-Type: application/json 
api-key: <apikey>

{
  "name" : "bob-json-indexer",
  "dataSourceName" : "blob-datasource",
  "targetIndexName" : "default",
  "schedule" : { "interval" : "PT2H" },
  "parameters" : { "configuration" : { "parsingMode" : "jsonArray", "documentRoot" : "/FHRSEstablishment/EstablishmentCollection/EstablishmentDetail" } },
  "fieldMappings" : [
    { "sourceFieldName" : "/FHRSID", "targetFieldName" : "id" },
    { "sourceFieldName" : "/BusinessName", "targetFieldName" : "businessname" }
    ]
}

```

6) Test! You can use the Azure Portal to test.  The Search instance has a Search Explorer that you can use to type in a search and run the query - or you can query the REST endpoint directly.  Here I show test results being returned using Search Explorer:
